# Better Rest

This project uses CoreML for suggesting the recommended time for bed, depending on such factors as:

- When the person wants to wake up.
- How many hours person wants to sleep.
- How many cups of coffee person drinks per day.

## Notes

All notes about techniques used are in [Introduction](https://github.com/Sangsom/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/tree/master/Project4%20-%20BetterRest/Introduction) folder.

## Challenges

- ✅ Replace each `VStack` in our form with a `Section`, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the `VStack` layout?
- ✅ Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a `Picker` showing the same range of values.
- ✅ Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
