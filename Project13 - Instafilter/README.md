## Notes

All notes about techniques used are in [Introduction](https://github.com/Sangsom/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/tree/master/Project13%20-%20Instafilter/Introduction) folder.

## Challenges

✅Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.  
✅Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.  
✅Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
