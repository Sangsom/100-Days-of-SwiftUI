## Challenges

✅Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if it’s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.  
✅If our call to `placeOrder()` fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, just disable WiFi on your Mac so the simulator has no connection either.
