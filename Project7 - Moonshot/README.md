# Moonshot

This app allows us to learn about missions and astronauts that formed NASA's Apollo space program.

## Notes

All notes about techniques used are in [Introduction](https://github.com/Sangsom/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/tree/master/Project7%20-%20Moonshot/Introduction) folder.

## Challenges

✅Modify `AstronautView` to show all the missions this astronaut flew on.  
✅Make a bar button in `ContentView` that toggles between showing launch dates and showing crew names.
