## Challenges

- ✅ Add an `@State` property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.
- ✅ Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
- ✅ When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
