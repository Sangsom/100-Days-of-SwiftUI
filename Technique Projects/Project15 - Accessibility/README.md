# Project 15 - Accessibility

## Notes

All notes about techniques used are in [Introduction](https://github.com/Sangsom/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/tree/master/Technique%20Projects/Project15%20-%20Accessibility/Introduction) folder.

## Challenges

✅ The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image that doesn’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read it out.  
✅Fix the steppers in BetterRest so that they read out useful information when the user adjusts their values.  
✅Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?
