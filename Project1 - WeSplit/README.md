## Challenges

- ✅ Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”.
- ✅ Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
- ✅ Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
