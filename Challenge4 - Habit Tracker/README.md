# Habit Tracker (Unfinished)

This App allows to add habits you want to track.

## Challenges

✅At the very least, this means there should be a list of all activities they want to track, plus a form to add new activities – a title and description should be enough.  
✅For a bigger challenge, tapping one of the activities should show a detail screen with the description, how many times they have completed it, plus a button incrementing their completion count.  
✅For an even bigger challenge, use `Codable` and `UserDefaults` to load and save all your data.
