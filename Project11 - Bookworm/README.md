# Bookworm

Bookworm app tracks which books you've read and what you thought of them.

## Notes

All notes about techniques used are in [Introduction](https://github.com/Sangsom/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/tree/master/Project11%20-%20Bookworm/Introduction) folder.

## Challenges

✅Right now it’s possible to select no genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing a default, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.
