# Bucket List

In this app users can build their private list of places on a map that they would like to visit, add description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage later.

## Notes

All notes about techniques used are in [Introduction](https://github.com/Sangsom/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/tree/master/Project14%20-%20Bucket%20List/Introduction) folder.

## Challenges

✅Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button – what difference does it make, and can you think why?  
✅Having a complex if condition in the middle of `ContentView` isn’t easy to read – can you rewrite it so that the `MapView`, `Circle`, and `Button` are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!  
✅Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one alert() modifier to each view.
